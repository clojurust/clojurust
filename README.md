# clojurust
A proof of concept version of Clojure in Rust.

## Goal
- Translate Clojure java code to Rust
- Test a way to have an interpreter of Clojure code
- Test a way to have a VM based on a FORTH system
- Test a way to dynamically compile Clojure code in machine code
- Test a way to create Rust, LLVM or Assembler code to compile Clojure code

### Translate Clojure java code to Rust
There are already some partial implementations.
- [ClojureRS](https://github.com/clojure-rs/ClojureRS)
- [MAL (make a lisp) Rust version](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/impls/rust)
